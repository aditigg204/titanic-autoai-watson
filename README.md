# Titanic Survival Prediction with IBM Watson AutoAI

This project uses IBM Watson Studio's **AutoAI** feature to predict passenger survival on the Titanic using the classic Titanic dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset includes features like:
- Passenger Class
- Sex
- Age
- Fare
- Embarked port
- etc.

 **Target Variable**: `Survived` (1 = survived, 0 = not)

##  Workflow (AutoAI did all this automatically)
- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Feature selection
- Model training (e.g., Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, etc.)
- Model selection (best-performing pipeline)
- Deployment-ready model
- Exported Python code

##  Files Included
- `titanic_autoai_notebook.ipynb`: Full experiment notebook generated by Watson
- `titanic.csv`: Dataset used
- `README.md`: This project guide

##  How to Use
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab
2. Run the cells to re-train or deploy the model
3. Modify to try new datasets or pipelines

##  Built with
- IBM Watson Studio
- IBM AutoAI
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
