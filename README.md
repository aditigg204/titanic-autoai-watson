#  Titanic Survival Prediction with IBM Watson AutoAI

This project uses **IBM Watson Studio's AutoAI** feature to predict passenger survival on the Titanic using the classic Titanic dataset.

---

##  Dataset

The dataset includes features like:
- Passenger Class (`Pclass`)
- Sex
- Age
- Fare
- Embarked Port
- etc.

** Target Variable**: `Survived` (1 = survived, 0 = not survived)

---

##  Workflow (AutoAI did this automatically)

-  Data cleaning & preprocessing  
-  Feature selection  
-  Model training (e.g., Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, etc.)  
-  Model selection (best-performing pipeline)  
-  Deployment-ready model with exportable code

##  Model Performance Metrics

| Metric             | Train Score     |   Test Score    |
|--------------------|----------------:|----------------:|
| Accuracy           | 0.8127          | 0.7444          |
| Average Precision  | 0.7908          | 0.7092          |
| Balanced Accuracy  | 0.7977          | 0.7597          |
| F1 Score           | 0.7498          | 0.7160          |
| Log Loss           | 0.7700          | 1.2660          |
| Precision          | 0.7690          | 0.6304          |
| Recall             | 0.7329          | 0.8286          |
| ROC AUC            | 0.8552          | 0.8031          |

>  The AutoAI-generated model shows solid performance with high recall and ROC AUC, indicating a good balance between precision and recall on unseen data.
